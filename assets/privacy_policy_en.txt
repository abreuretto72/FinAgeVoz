Privacy Policy - FinAgeVoz
Last updated: December 09, 2025

Your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy describes how the FinAgeVoz application, developed by Multiverso Digital ("we", "our"), collects, uses, and protects your information.

FinAgeVoz operates on a "Freemium" model (free and paid features), without displaying third-party advertising.

1. Information We Collect
A. Account Data (Synchronization)
To allow you to access your data across multiple devices, we may collect:

Name and Email Address (via Google Sign-In or Apple ID).

Unique user identifier (User ID).

B. Financial and Health Data (Your Private Data)
This data is essential for the app's functionality:

Financial: Records of expenses, income, budgets, and categories.

Health: Medication names, dosage schedules, and intake history.

Storage: This data is securely stored in the cloud (Google Firebase) and encrypted in transit. We do not sell, rent, or share this data with third parties for marketing purposes.

C. Voice Data
The application uses the microphone strictly to convert your voice commands into actions (Speech-to-Text).

Audio is processed and discarded immediately after conversion. No voice recordings are permanently stored on our servers.

D. Technical and Usage Data (Analytics)
We use Google Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics to improve app stability.

What is collected: Device model, operating system, crash reports, and anonymous usage metrics (e.g., "average time on agenda screen").

Purpose: Identify technical errors and improve usability.

2. Subscriptions and Payments
FinAgeVoz offers Premium subscriptions.

Processing: All transactions are processed directly by Google Play Store or Apple App Store.

Security: We do not have access to or store your credit card numbers. We only receive technical confirmation that the subscription is active.

3. Your Rights (GDPR and LGPD)
You have full control over your data:

Right of Access and Correction: You can view and edit your data directly in the application.

Right to Deletion (Right to be Forgotten): You can request complete deletion of your account and all associated data at any time through Settings > Profile > Delete Account.

Consent Revocation: You can revoke access to the microphone or notifications in your device settings.

4. Data Sharing
We share strictly necessary data only with our secure infrastructure providers:

Google Firebase: For database and authentication.

Google Play/Apple: For subscription management.

5. Children's Privacy
FinAgeVoz is not directed at children under 13 years of age. We do not intentionally collect data from children.
